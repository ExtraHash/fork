          <h3>Announcing Your Network's Existence</h3>
          <p>Getting yourself noticed in the proper places is a great way to get started in the community. In the past, we've been limited to making announcement threads on forums where it may cost money to post. In the old days it may have been expected to post on a single website to announce your project, but times are changing. </p><br>

          <br>
          <p>ForkMaps.com is a website made by a TurtleCoin user Jerme404 who wanted to index all of the various CryptoNote forks in existence, and map their lineages to indicate who they forked their code from. This helps illustrate which projects are out there getting the most attention, and coincidentally shows you how awesome TurtleCoin is for people wanting to learn about blockchain programming.</p>
          <p><strong>You can list your network on ForkMaps by submitting your info here: </strong><a href="https://github.com/ForkMaps/cryptonote"><li>https://github.com/ForkMaps/cryptonote</li></a></p>

          <h3>Building A Website The Smart Way</h3>
          <p>Our website is actually hosted for free on Github.com, with no ads or fees. This allows you to have a 100% uptime website that loads quickly and is already set up for multiple people to collaborate together on the design.</p>
          <p>Unlike normal websites, our website is written in Markdown, which is more approachable for nerdy people these days than HTML. Github interprets markdown natively, and inserts the appropriate language words into fields of templates you create.</p>

          <h3>Real Time Chat</h3>
          <p>Whether you choose IRC or Telegram or Discord, it is important to have a developer presence on some type of real-time chat medium. Our favorite is Discord, and we use Keybase.io as a backup.</p>
          <ul>
	          <li>Discord is especially handy because we use the roles function to give different users different jobs and responsibilities. You can create different categories of rooms with automation and bots and voice chat functionality. This is by far the most recommended option.</li>
	          <li>Keybase is important to us as a backup means of chat, and also serves as an encrypted chat service. Keybase uses multiple forms of establishing someone's internet identity, and provides other free services like encryped file storage, private git service, group chat, direct messaging, and more.</li>
	          <li>IRC is a tried and true method of communication, although it has more basic features than more contemporary chat services. Most of the IRC servers that are popular today will allow you to create rooms for free, however your userbase may lack the knowledge required to connect easily.</li>
	          <li>Slack is another popular option, similar to Discord, but with less options concerning user management, and more expensive for larger communities.</li>
	      </ul>

      <br />
      <div><img  class="mx-auto img-fluid" style="display: block; width: auto;" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34389545/45662555-e8c66180-baf1-11e8-8665-4ead17a102fa.png" class="img-fluid" alt="meta.turtlecoin.lol Meta Forum">  </div>
      <center><small class="text-muted">meta.TurtleCoin.lol - TurtleCoin Meta Forum</small></center><br>   
           
    <h3>Long Discussion</h3>
          <p>No matter how busy and robust your real time chat options are, you will need a place that is more 'sticky' for information and ongoing discussions. For this purpose, we have a meta-forum that is basically a Github repository, where we use the "Issues" function like forum posts. Using Github as our forum allows us to make a short path between developers and users, and best of all, it is free for anyone to make an account.</p>
          <ul>
	          <li>TurtleCoin, and other projects like Monero use Github to build a meta repository that serves as a basic forum. Work can be delegated and discussions can be tagged with different labels to help categorize them. If you like the look of Discourse, but don't want to mess with hosting it or paying someone else to host your forum, this is a good option.</li>
	          <li>Reddit is a great option for a free forum with an inherently high amount of user traffic by default. Reddit can be a bit unique in the way it is run, but as long as you aren't being blatantly offensive or unethical, you should be able to operate undisturbed. An active subreddit has at least one post per day.</li>
	          <li>Discourse is a popular option that a lot of projects run, and many cloud providers like Digital Ocean can host for a small monthly fee. This requires a little bit more maintenance, but if you require the utmost degree of customization, this is a good choice.</li>
	          <li>Something we find very useful in this industry is Twitter. Everyone should have a twitter even if it is just to make automated posts every time you update the Github with a new release. Increasing your sphere of awareness also helps you keep in touch with other projects and monitor their developments.</li>
	      </ul>
	      
      <br />      
	<h3>The 10 Commandments of Community Relations</h3>
          <p>Successful communities in this field thrive on constant communication with the user base. This close relationship allows a free flow of information between both parties that helps deal with problems head on before they get out of control. An uninformed and uneducated userbase is restless, and when users get restless they make assumptions, especially in the beginning when you have very little rapport to rely on. Here are some quick tips for keeping your community happy and knowledgeable:</p>
          <ol>
	          <li><strong>Give tangible updates frequently </strong>- At TurtleCoin we do a weekly update, where we get a quote and a link to everyone who is working on a TurtleCoin app or initiative. A one sentence saying "yeah we worked on this piece" without giving any details of what you did or why you did it is not a tangible update. The purpose of this update is to show the community that work was done this week, and to give them an idea roughly of what is needed to complete the task. This inspires confidence in the users reading the updates, and is inviting to other developers to contact us and pitch in.</li>
	          <li><strong>Educate, Educate, Educate </strong>- If you get asked the same question twice, it should prompt you to write a blog article of some type of post explaining the question and the answer. This also applies to private messages, direct messages, etc. Turn off your private messages, because they are just a way for users to train you to spoonfeed them information. If you handle all troubleshooting and interpersonal issues in the open, you can educate everyone in the community, and help the community educate themselves by instructing the user with a solution in the open. Many people have questions and don't ask, or sometimes don't even know they had a question, but they'll listen to you explain anything if you're there being present and helping people. Eventually the community coaches themselves and you're not required or relied on for this. Compare this to people who indulge every question via private message and then rage on users in the chat who ask about a basic question when they've finally had enough.</li>
	          <li><strong>Be the most present members in the community </strong>- In the beginning specifically, the first year, it is very important for the core members and developers to be present often, and reachable by the community. Your developers should be the most active chatters and posters in the community. If the user feels like they're "bothering" you by contacting you, something is wrong.</li>
	          <li><strong>Accept and realize the truths in every criticism </strong>- Every negative review and usually every verbal 'attack' has a grain of truth inside it. Do not be part of arguments, and do not answer questions with "read the fucking manual". Only the most repeat offenders should be shown a link to Google. Take care of everyone, and understand that your biggest critics will become your biggest supporters when you help them instead of banning them.</li>
	          <li><strong>Never censor or ban users</strong> - Unless someone is posting NSFW or illegal content repeatedly despite warnings, we will not ban them. Not everyone speaks english natively or has a full understanding about how any of this works. Some questions can sound like accusations but if you take a second to breathe and answer these questions with patience, you will always win. In the TurtleCoin server, we have a sub-channel called #Exile where problem users are put as a place to use as a free speech zone. They're effectively contained in one room, and any users who might be offended by their views can cafely ignore them. Almost everyone who enters #Exile has redeemed themselves, and a few picked up the skill of programming while doing their time, and became core developers after. Everyone has a chance to redeem themselves, and you should give them that chance. </li>
	          <li><strong>Be humble</strong> - it's okay for users to talk about other networks or link to materials about other networks if they're just trying to have a discussion. Blatant promotion is never welcome without substance, but developers or community managers who actively encourage a topic-only chat appear very insecure and ignorant of progress around them.</li>
	          <li><strong>Rules are understood, don't be overbaring</strong> - It's understood that you shouldn't post pornographic memes, or blatantly shill scam coins in the main chat room, so you shouldn't beat every user over the head with a rulebook of obvious regulations when they enter the chat. Pick one rule, maybe two, that are probably not implied, and kindly inform someone <em>when they break the rule</em> what happened and why it's not allowed. Some people will be repeat offenders, and that's okay, you'll coach them out of it. Some people just forget, but eventually your community will self-police this short list of rules if you trust them to have that responsibility. You should not have more than 1 "moderator" per 100 users. Overbearing moderation turns into a disaster 9 times out of 10, and in the beginning it is more important to build numbers quickly.</li>
	          <li><strong>Be honest with your commitments</strong> - Don't lie to your communty or estimate on deliverable dates. Your community is happier hearing you say something like "I am just one person and I don't know when feature XYZ be done, but I am attempting to implement XYZ, and the first steps of it took me a month so far, but if you help me it could go faster, here's two or three things you can probably help with, will you help me" rather than have you give them the date they want to hear on a feature you haven't researched yet and lack the resources to delivery in a working state by the date mentioned. Nobody likes being lied to or let down, and everyone knows a guy who's a lone wolf and only knows how to deliver an excuse on time, so it's okay to say "I don't know" when people ask when something is done. Be confident in your time and and learn to be rely on  openness of communication and many updates to calm down the "when moon" crowd.</li>
	          <li><strong>Give the community skin in the game</strong> - Give them ownership over tasks, duties, rewards, and shower them with positive reinforcement when they do things for the community. You can't do everything yourself, accept that fact; a community member that is running services or creating things around your network is a member that isn't going to be leaving any time soon. These users are critical to fostering engagement with their spheres of influence. Recognize them immediately and often. People just want to be appreciated for their efforts. It may be a task you could have done, or it could be a job you could have done better, but the fact is someone did it for you, and most of the time they've done it for free. What you do in this situation is you tape their creation to your refrigerator with a smile like a proud parent and acknowledge the qualities you admire about what they've made for you. Praise often and praise publicly. You'll inspire others to strive for your appreciation and admiration.</li>
	          <li><strong>Listen to the community, even when they're wrong</strong> - your community doesn't have to dictate every single action and it shouldn't require an act of congress and an entire committee to change a Twitter Avatar. You will always have a subset of the community that parrots the same sentences they've heard in the past that translate roughly to "please do this thing now that I've invested so I can get a quick profit on my investment". These inane requests include concepts like buybacks, coin burns, air drops, and exchange listing after exchange listing when there is no volume to support a new market. You will become the support staff when things go wrong at these shitcoin exchanges desperate projects pay to be on. These obvious pump attempts are safe to ignore, from your users, but you have to educate your community on why a new echange doesnt make sense, (especially if it costs money and only associates you with other no-name networks and a history of bad support tickets). While this is true, if you took a premine or a mining tax, it is imperative you set up a type of managed trust or community advisory group to help steward some of those funds. If the community thinks a listing on ABC Shitcoin exchange is in their best interest, let them fund it with their community endowment fund and learn why it's a bad idea first hand.  Keeping a founder's premine is fine, but there needs to be an equal portion for the community to manage and use for things they need, like funding development bounties or for user growth events and meetups. Your community will keep a knife at your neck and an eye in every inch of your business for every hour of your existence if they feel like you're abusing their trust or generosity with your funds. Do not give 100% of the community's funds to the first round of people who volunteer to be community advisors. Most often, those who ask for positions of leadership are not the ones you want to be leading things. Your community premine funds should stay locked for the first few months, with a publicly viewable view key for the community to verify its existence. This gives you and the community time to build rapport and familiarity. Those that are most qualified for the job will make themselves known in most cases.</li>

          <h1 class="display-4">Brand Image</h1>
          <hr />
          <br>
          <h3>Optics</h3>
          <p>The integrity of your image, the way you are perceived, and the respect for your brand are a product of the consistency of your visual presence. At first read you may associate this statement with only visual elements like colors and styles, but it's important to note the visible social interactions as well. Always be on your best behavior. It's better to be to attacked than to be the attacker. As leadership, you're held to a higher standard than others in a public setting.</p>
          <h3>Your Social Persona</h3>
          <p>An important part about frequent updates to the community is the frequent small updates on social platforms. You want to avoid the notion that you're a developer who can do everything under the sun. Your social presence is something you can easily delegate to the community in the form of a Community Manager. Find someone to manage your Instagram or Twitter presence and ensure that they're posting relevant content often and consistently several times a week. This person should have positive rapport with the community, and a high degree of accountability.</p>
          <p>When engaging with the community in these real time forms of communication, it is important that no matter what the situation to always keep your cool and speak respectfully to the community, without exception. One thing that not everyone understands is that there is a subliminal double standard- a developer or member of leadership is expected to be responsible, patient, helpful and courteous at all times, but a user is accepted when they choose to be irrational, unpredictable, and not knowledgeable. It is our responsibility as mature leaders to acknowledge this fact to ourselves silently, and handle every situation and conflict with patience and grace with the understanding that we won't win every argument and that' okay. It doesn't matter if you're right, it doesn't matter if someone took it to a personal level, it is not your place to use your priveleges to get personal revenge. If the community sees you lashing out and banning users for being critical of your skills or motivations, it does not inspire confidence or stability and appears juvenile.
          <p>Along with good interpersonal relations, it is also important to engage with communities outside your own. This can seem a bit overwhelming, but you should maintain rapport with other Cryptonote communities, especially if you're the guy at the top. There are two types of developers- there's the guy who thinks he's better than everyone, develops in private, fails alone, and barks at the community when they ask to know more, then there's the developer who leans on others for help, contributes back his solutions when he finds them, and discusses concepts or ideas humbly and openly with others. You won't find many developers worth their salt who disagree with open source colaboration or assume they're ideas are better than others without justification. Developers and community leaders who don't humble themselves enough to make friends are an immediate red flag to users. Contribute to other projects often. Even if your accomplishments don't get acknowleged directly, others will see your work an recognize you for your merits. You will never lose favor in the court of public opinion by helping others without expecting payment in return.</p>

          <h3>Visual Identity</h3>
          <p>You've likely given this some thought already, but more important than your fonts and logos are how they are communicated to the user. You don't want your name mispelled, and you also don't want your logo misused or edited incorrectly. Most of these are honest mistakes, but someone trying to promote your coin has no way of knowing what is and isn't okay to do with your logo unless you tell them, so this is why we built a presskit to show them.</p> 
          <p>A presskit is a document that shows marketers and news agencies how your logo and trademark should be represented, and how it should be displayed in different formats, and what fonts should be used when reproducing the wordmark.</p>
          <div><img  class="mx-auto img-fluid" style="display: block; width: auto;" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34389545/45662733-90dc2a80-baf2-11e8-9663-7506a214fe93.png" class="img-fluid" alt="brand.turtlecoin.lol - style do's and dont's"></div>
          <center><small class="text-muted">brand.turtlecoin.lol - do's and don'ts</small></center><br>
          <p>Your visual presentation across all of your social media accounts and visual assets should conform to the standard in your presskit. Consistent appearance makes your brand strong and easily identifiable among others. Avatars and wallpapers should match on all accounts, usernames should match, domain names should be relatable and easily spelled phonetically.</p>
